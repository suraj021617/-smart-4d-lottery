=== QUICK FIX INSTRUCTIONS ===

Your lottery system has 3 main issues:

1. MIXED NUMBER FORMATS: 4D, 5D, and 6D numbers are mixed together
2. DATA PARSING STOPS AT 2025-07-13: System not reading latest data
3. WRONG PREDICTIONS: System shows predictions for wrong dates

IMMEDIATE SOLUTIONS:

1. ADD LOTTERY TYPE SELECTION:
   - Copy code from 'app_lottery_types_update.py' to your app.py
   - Copy 'lottery_types.html' to your templates folder
   - Add route: /lottery-types

2. UPDATE YOUR HOME PAGE:
   Add this button to your main page:
   
   <a href="/lottery-types" class="nav-btn">🎲 Select Lottery Type</a>

3. SEPARATE PREDICTIONS:
   Instead of mixing all numbers, users can now choose:
   - 4D Predictions (for GDLotto)
   - 5D Predictions (for SportsToto)  
   - 6D Predictions (for Da Ma Cai)

4. FIX DATA PARSING:
   In your load_data() function, add:
   
   # Filter out invalid dates
   df = df[df['Date'].notna()]
   df = df[df['Date'] != '']
   
   # Ensure latest data is included
   df = df.sort_values('Date')

TESTING:
1. Run your app
2. Go to /lottery-types
3. Click on "4D Lottery" 
4. Should show only 4-digit predictions
5. Click on "5D Lottery"
6. Should show only 5-digit predictions

This will immediately fix the mixed number format issue!
